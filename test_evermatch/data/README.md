# Test data for the PPS package

This directory contains input data sets that can be used to test the package.

To execute the solve code or any action locally, see [constants.py](../../evermatch/constants.py).

## Directory guide
 * *inputs* - Mimics the *Inputs* folder of OpenX. Specifically, it hosts a, possibly modified, copy of the raw input 
    data set generated by the data ingestion action. All actions (except the data ingestion action) and the solve code
    read from the input directory when executed locally.
 * *outputs* - Mimics the *Output* folder of OpenX. Specifically, it hosts the output from the solve code and/or 
    output actions when executed locally.

All the other folders are raw input data sets that mimic the client data source.
