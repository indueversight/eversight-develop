# Eversight Matching Problem

Eversight (eyes bank) has the daily task of matching eyes tissues from donors to surgeons.

Eye tissues become available throughout the United States as donors pass away, and the list of 
available tissues along with its specificities get updated throughout the day.

Similarly, tissue requests from surgeons come from different places in the United States and even from abroad. 
The list of requests along with surgeon preferences also get updated throughout the day.

However, not every tissue attends all the surgeonâ€™s preferences/requirements for a tissue request. 
For example, a surgeon may request a tissue from a donor that was between 58 and 72-years-old.

The goal is to match tissues to requests as to meet all the preferences as much as possible while 
accounting for multiple operational constraints, such as processing location and shipping time.
